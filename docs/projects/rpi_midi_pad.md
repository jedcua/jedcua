The Musical Instrument Digital Interface, or [MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI), is a standard for defining a sequence of musical events such as playing a note or changing the tempo. It is usually represented as a file with `.midi` or `.mid` extension. Unlike an [audio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_file_format) file, such as `.wav` or `.mp3`, MIDI only contains the instruction on what, how and when the notes are to be played just like a music sheet; whereas an audio file is a stream of data that sounds _almost_ exactly as recorded.

For this project, we are going to animate an 8x8 LED Dot Matrix with MIDI!
